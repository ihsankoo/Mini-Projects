This code may be very helpful to the people working with multiple datasets in python. The code generates a list of strings 'df_0', 'df_1', ..., 'df_n' where n is the number of files in the current directory. Then, it iterates through all the files in the current directory and checks if each file has a '.csv' extension. If it does, it reads the csv file into a Pandas DataFrame and stores it in a dictionary called 'myVars' with the keys being the names generated in the list 'df_list'.
