I have a cool solution for attendance monitoring. I developed a Slack Attendance Bot that helps you monitor attendance in real-time. It connects to a Google Spreadsheet and sends notifications to a designated person on Slack if an employee's or student's attendance drops below 80% in a week. It's a quick and easy way to stay on top of attendance, so you can make sure your team or students are always on track.
